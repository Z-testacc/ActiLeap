## 🧠 AI-Powered Coaching System

- **Smart Recommendations**: An "AI Coach" analyzes your fitness goals, workout history, and preferences to generate tailored workout plans.
- **Adaptive Training Plans**: The AI provides "Smart Insights" by analyzing your workout logs to detect progress plateaus or signs of overtraining, offering actionable recommendations to adapt your routine.
- **AI-Driven Recovery Guidance**: The AI coach intelligently suggests recovery-focused workouts (like stretching or yoga) when it detects a high frequency of intense activity, helping to prevent burnout and injury.
- **Personalized Motivation**: The dashboard features a dynamic summary from the AI coach, providing a motivating message tailored to your recommended workout for the day.

## ⛑️ Emergency & Safety System

- **SOS Button**: A prominent, pulsing red SOS button is available during all workout sessions. Activating it (after a confirmation) simulates notifying pre-set emergency contacts.
- **Live Health Alerts**: The dashboard includes a "Live Wearable Stats" card that simulates real-time data. The UI changes color to indicate warnings (high heart rate) or critical alerts.
- **Safety Settings**: A dedicated section in the settings menu allows users to configure their safety preferences, including placeholders for emergency contacts and custom health alert thresholds.

## 🎨 Design & UI/UX

ActiveLeap features a complete, modern front-end redesign built for engagement and accessibility.
- **Modern Design System**: A consistent visual language with a vibrant color palette (Electric Blue, Lime Green, Sunset Orange), clear typography, and a soft gray background.
- **Smooth Animations**: From fade-in cards on the dashboard to a sliding underline on tabs, the interface is full of smooth, meaningful motion.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Small, delightful details like a pulsing "Start Workout" button and a bouncing "Like" button make the app feel alive and responsive.
- **Accessibility-Friendly Visuals**: The app includes options for voice guidance and a low-bandwidth mode to ensure it's usable for everyone.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with App Router)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **AI / Generative**: [Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) (for AI flows) and [Google AI](https://ai.google/)
- **Backend & Database**: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (Firestore, Authentication, App Hosting)

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or yarn/pnpm)
*   A [Firebase Project](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

### Firebase Setup

This project is configured to work seamlessly with Firebase.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project**: If you don't have one already, create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  **Add a Web App**: In your Firebase project, add a new Web application. This will provide you with the configuration keys needed for the next step.
3.  **Enable Firestore & Authentication**: In the Firebase console, enable **Firestore** (in production mode) and **Firebase Authentication** (with the "Anonymous" sign-in provider).

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project. This file will hold your configuration keys.

You will need two sets of keys: one for Firebase and one for the Google AI (Gemini) models used by Genkit.

1.  **Firebase Keys**: Add your Firebase project's configuration keys to the `.env.local` file:
    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
    ```

2.  **Google AI (Gemini) Key**: To run the AI features locally, you need a Gemini API key.
    -   Get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    -   Add the key to your `.env.local` file:
    ```bash
    GEMINI_API_KEY=...
    ```

### Installation & Running the App

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server**:
    This command starts the Next.js development server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

3.  **Run the Genkit AI Flows (Optional)**:
    The AI flows are bundled with the Next.js server. However, if you want to run them in a separate debugging process, you can use:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    This will start the Genkit development server, allowing you to inspect and test your AI flows independently.

## 📂 Project Structure

A brief overview of the key directories in the project:

-   `src/app/`: The core of the Next.js application, using the App Router.
-   `src/ai/`: Contains all Genkit-related code, including AI flows and prompts.
-   `src/components/`: Shared React components used across the application, including the `ui` components from ShadCN.
-   `src/firebase/`: Holds all Firebase-related code, including initialization, providers, hooks, and Firestore data-access functions.
-   `src/lib/`: Contains utility functions, static data (`workouts`, `achievements`), and type definitions.
-   `docs/`: Includes the `backend.json` file, which serves as a blueprint for the app's data structures.
-   `firestore.rules`: The security rules for the Firestore database.
